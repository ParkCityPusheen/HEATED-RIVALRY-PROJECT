There had always been a shitload of things for Shane to consider, it had been evident when she and Shane had begun their failed attempt at courting each other and even more so as Rose had slowly gotten closer to him. He was a natural at shouldering it all, remembering small details, panicking about the things he couldn't control, steamrolling over everything else in his inevitable glory conquest. She'd noticed Shane often kept his plate unnecessarily full, but in his own design of life it worked out for him; his greatest performances and failures had been executed under solar systems worth of stress and expectation.

So, seeing him swimming in his *husband's* sweater, just days after their wedding, nearly grinning with a head full of undone hair, blinking behind the thin lenses of his glasses, she realizes she's never once actually seen him... well...

Happy.

"Those are scandalous, girl." Rose gapes, wincing at how shrill her voice sounds in contrast to Shane's warm and cozy appearance.

Shane's grin shrinks into something shy and special,

"Four-inch inseam," he stammers, "They are kind of small looking with this, uh—" she nearly gets cavities when the skin beneath his freckles dust pink, "—in Ilya's shirt."

Rose blinks.

Shane is lean himself, built very much like a wildcat, lithe and sinewy, agile and sporting muscle noticeable underneath his skin as he moves quietly around a room. By no means is this man *small.* But Ilya? His husband?

She's not surprised at his taste, at least in regards to Ilya's physical anatomy.

Ilya is *breathtaking.*

She shakes herself mentally: no she will not sexualize her best friend's husband, not right now at least, "I think he'd like this a lot." she presents him a snarky smirk and her voice smolders, 

"He's a pervert."

Shane rolls his eyes and gestures for her to come in, "Come on, it's freezing."

"Weird isn't it," Rose sighs, reluctantly letting Shane take her bag and suitcase from her, "this storm."

"Could be. Maybe we're straining the planet more than we think." Shane adds thoughtfully while patting the snow off of her belongings, "You know, like global warming and stuff."

They both stare at the front door.

"Alrighty, I want a tour now, of House Hollanov."

Shane's face flushes more deeply and Rose can't help reaching out to cup his cheek, "House Hollanov?" he echoes,

"Haven't you seen the posts about you guys? It's the universally recognized title for the two of you as a couple on most platforms. Hollander-Rosanov, *Hollanov."*

Shane shakes his head, "I promised Ilya I wouldn't look at any social media until the start of next season."

"Good," Rose scoffs, "not that there's been anything bad or that you should even care; but people are super receptive to the two of you. I'm actually very pleasantly surprised Shane."

His tiny smile reappears before stretching into a proud, toothy grin, "Well that's good."

"Of course it is, now show me to my room!"

Shane giggles and spins around on his slipper-ed and socked feet and launches into a monologue. Rose soaks in his build from behind; he's twice her width and bearing a taper from his ribs and waist to his hips that runway models would certainly do indescribably evil deeds to attain,

"I wouldn't let Ilya sell his house on the other side of town, but he insisted we go house shopping together. He's had most of my firsts and wanted the 'first-time-buying-a-home-and-moving-in-together' one too." Shane groans as they enter their living room, stopping just before a disgustingly expensive-looking throw rug,

"I could only deny him for a few months though, so." He shrugs and makes a grand gesture at the space.

"Can't tell if I'm more surprised that you gave in or that he didn't give up." Rose snorts, to which Shane rolls his eyes,

"It's only a five bedroom, six and a half bath house—well, uh, there's an attached garage with a finished apartment above it so our parents can stay whenever and as long as they want, but he only lets them in there. He says that's their house."

Rose tilts her head; she'd been certain both of Ilya Rosanov's parents had passed, considering the Charity founded in ode to his mother, and his father having died recently.

"Do his parents come out here too?" she asks carefully.

Shane jumps a bit, fidgeting nervously, "Well no, both of his passed. I meant, well mine. He's been calling mom *mom* lately so, I guess..."

Rose wants to hug him so tightly that his head pops off, but instead she just rubs his shoulders, "Cavities. I'm going to get cavities because of how sweet you are, Shane Hollander."

Those long lashes of his flutter, before he whines bashfully, "I don't know. But anyway this is the living room, and the kitchen is just past that wall."

Their living room is humble, encapsulated in wood paneling that's cured in a warm stain with thick wall-to-wall beams overhead, their furniture is leather, midnight black with green throw pillows and the biggest Russian flag she'd ever seen in her life hanging against the wall behind the biggest couch in their sitting area. Rose thinks for a moment it's rather patriotic for a person who almost never speaks about his homeland. She drags her feet through the brown fur rug beneath them and considers taking her socks off to feel the fibers against the soles of her feet,

"What is this?"

Shane glances down, "Some kind of synthetic fur. Ilya wanted a fake bear pelt."

"Ew." Rose side-eyes Shane, "obviously that would never happen."

"Not a hot day in fucking hell." Shane quips before stalking off to the kitchen area; here he stops just before his kitchen island and watches Rose curiously poke about.

It's like the living room, spacious, a formal kitchen table, a bar attached to the island that could seat six or seven people, the kitchen itself had a setup professional chefs would probably kill for. The Hollanov's kitchen is a warm, terracotta-like orange, with Spanish tiling brandished across its floor—upon further inspection most of their kitchen is rather Spanish influenced,

"Did this style perhaps come from your honeymoon?" she presses expectantly.

Shane nods, "We loved the architecture in Spain, especially the churches. We brought it home because..." he looks fondly around the room, "We were able to be ourselves entirely out there. It's like no one even noticed us. No matter how obnoxious Ilya was being."

"Wait okay, so how even was it?! You hadn't texted me once. Bitch, it's been a whole four weeks since your wedding!"

He holds his hands high about his head, "We agreed to not use our phones unless it was for work!"

Rose lifts her chin indignantly, "I mean I'm not thinking I'm special or anything, but like *spill?"*

He fractures into thousands of pieces of sunshine almost instantaneously, he draws her in when she slides into a plush barstool while listening to his romantic elopement.

Shane begins in the private jet booked for them by the Centaur's owners, how they slept the whole flight in an actual *bed,* how Ilya took advantage of the bed itself (he's a pervert is what Rose had said but if she was Ilya Rosanov flying off to some far away land with Shane Hollander she would've ravished him too, please be so forreal).

They spent hours in the hotel's private spa, they ate fruits, and light desserts, drank so many champagne flutes he'd developed an affinity for them—and Shane Hollander did *not* participate in casual drinking, so Rose wondered just how good those mimosas had been.

They, and she nearly grips her heart through her ribcage and rips it out of her chest when he sputters explaining this, held hands walking through the streets of Spain, in four different cities, with their eyes glued to churches and corner stores. Allegedly the Spaniards are as infatuated as Shane is about Ilya's thickass accent, and they're stopped left and right whenever his husband exclaims too loudly at something, or asks for directions or the history about a certain someplace they'd seen,

"We went on our first date in Madrid," he nearly gushes, "Ilya got us a reservation at some Michelin restaurant, we had a private shopping session beforehand and these ladies took, like three hours picking a week's worth of clothes out for us. Except it was like they thought we'd be changing every quarter of the day. But we both looked great, and Ilya was so sweet. He normally does this, but I felt—" Shane stops, then starts again,

"It was amazing, we were seated in like, the middle of the restaurant. Rose, nobody cared."

The words rush out of him like a riptide; they're so simple and small but they dig into her stomach as they flood her ears and drag her down into his experiences. How long had he lived suppressed, and alone, and bursting with all of this love and joy and hope? Seconds scrape by as she realizes just how privileged she'd been, loving out loud and boundless, while Shane was standing here in his kitchen beaming about his first date ever at thirty. With the man he'd been secretly in love with for nearly a decade. That they held hands on the way to brunch and lunch and dinner, that they kissed with their toes covered in sand, hugged under blinding sunlight, flirted in the fucking streets.

All of these *regular* things, listed off like heavenly privileges to Shane.

His phone vibrates and Rose is shucked out of her guilt, "Ilya just got Svetlana, apparently it's getting worse. Whole airport was on backup generators; they're on their way back now."

Rose pops up from the barstool, "Svetlana is still here?!"

"She is." Shane answers, smiling still.

"She's coming here? Me, you, Ilya, and Svetlana?"

Shane shuffles around a bit, fucking cutie, "Yes. Me, you, Ilya, and Svetlana."

"I hope this storm lasts for at least a week."
