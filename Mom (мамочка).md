Right after the crushing anxiety in wondering whether his mother would accept him, there was his relationship with Ilya, and then... just *Ilya.*

Shane knew his lover and he most certainly knew his mother.

Ilya was an unstoppable force. He was an uncontrollable blizzard ripping across landscapes and people alike, permanently marking them with his broken English and unpredictable behavior. On the ice he was a contagious virus, infecting his oppenent and dragging them down to their mental depths with childish chirps and mockery. 

Ilya was the opposite of Shane in most ways.

Shane's mother, Yuna, was calculated and observant, much like her son, but also adventurous in her own purposeful way. She maintained her reservations though they were easily displayed on her face in any given moment—so he watched for the hints of disapproval towards his lover there. They would be buried behind twinkling brown eyes and soft smile lines, etched in the creases of her crow's feet and present in the tightness of her shoulders.

He doesn't ask Ilya to temper himself for his parents' digestion and he never would, he only nervously watches them from his seat at the kitchen table as they move around each other. Panics nearly every time Ilya's mouth drops open and his accent fills the rooms they all occupy like a blanket of snow. Surprisingly that accent Ilya bears, rich and alien and heavy, Shane knows Yuna is secretly enjoying hearing it.

He can tell in the way she prompts him into speech with frivolous conversation. Conversation that Ilya would never otherwise entertain if it *weren't* Yuna.

"So what's the plan if the two of you get caught?"

Her questions aren't the quick back-and-forth kind though, and Shane watches as Ilya is forced to consider his answers before handing them over. His boyfriend and mother flit about the kitchen while Shane observes, eyes bouncing to whoever speaks,

"Is up to Shane." Ilya responds nonchalantly while padding from the pantry with a can of skinned tomatoes back into the kitchen, "Do you have plan?"

Yuna takes the can from Ilya, her eyes narrow in thought as the Russian looms over her, "I've thought of a few but it's really awful the more I think about it."

"What? The plan?" Ilya rumbles, voice cavernous and swelling in the Hollanders' kitchen.

"No." his mother's head sways with worry, "No not my plan."

Shane's eyes follow her as she closes a five foot trek to her cooking range over the course of thirty seconds in deep thought.

"No," she sighs again; she's agitated, but at what?

Ilya doesn't respond, but he trails after her like a baby duckling, taking two of the five feet she required to station himself next to her just before the range.

Yuna blinks up at him after adjusting a cotton shawl across her shoulders, "Living in secret like this. Loving so loudly in private."

Her shoulders sink.

"I absolutely hate this for you two."

Ilya nods, his hip drops as he shifts his weight from one leg to the other, "Is okay."

Yuna only groans in response, silence buffering around the two once more as she steps away from the stoves to collect the utensils and cooking wares she'll need. Ilya, once again, is at her heels, somehow in all of his six-foot-three silhouette he manages to gracefully avoid being in her way all the while receiving pots and food items from her as directed. He's only been here now four times now and it's remarkable just how well he's adjusted to Shane's parents.

"If I wasn't the best player in the NHL we would not need to worry about sharing our relationship." Ilya pauses while holding a large sauce pot, thinking, "I forget how heavy the burden is; being the greatest."

Yuna makes a point to turn directly to Ilya, rolling her eyes so hard they go completely white, "That's exactly right, Ilya."

Shane's father grunts in shared enthusiasm, nodding while Yuna pats Ilya's bicep with obvious exasperation. Ilya only grins that stupid steamy, lopsided smile of his.

"Open that, then pour it into this pot." Yuna commands, pointing at the can of tomatoes that they'd both abandoned on the kitchen counter, by the ranges.

"Okay."

"So, Ilya, what do your parents do?" his mother asks this time, much to Shane's dismay.

Shane sucks in a sharp breath and fidgets in his seat next to his father, words tumble from his mouth before he can even consider them,

"Mom—"

Ilya's eyes meet his for the first time in minutes, they're soft, lazy like the bittersweet smile he offers to Yuna as he cuts off Shane.

"They have passed." he clears his throat, and Shane clutches his gingerale while searching Ilya's face  for discomfort, "I lost my father recently, and my mother when I was twelve."

Yuna's head snaps up from the pot where Ilya had just dumped the canned tomato into, blinking rapidly, "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked that so casually."

"No," Ilya turns his back to stovetop, leaning against the counter top while crossing his arms, "Is okay."

"It's been a week now," Shane's dad begins, squashing the awkwardness before it can fester, "Are you heading back to Russia at all?"

Ilya's eyes pass over Yuna to look at David, "I will stay with Shane."

His father looks at him, a glance really, before smiling wide, "That's nice. You won't miss home?"

"I never miss home." Ilya states matter-of-factly, hazel eyes sharp, "I don't want to go back either."

"Too cold?" David presses,

"The people, yes."

Shane feels a pang of guilt; he hadn't talked much to Ilya about Russia in general, though it was obvious he didn't want much to do with it. 

His mother speaks up again, "So what are you going to do your last week here?"

"Swim with Shane, and cook with Shane..." his *boyfriend's* eyes tear a hole across the kitchen floor finding him, "Just enjoy Shane properly."

Yuna lifts her wooden spoon, gracefully pointing it at Ilya then her son, "Damn lovebirds."

"Honestly. That's all you want to do? Don't want to party or anything?" David insists.

"Maybe with Shane? But would be weird if we are at club together and no one else." Ilya turns his body to face Yuna entirely, "No I just want to stay at the cottage."

"I can't believe this still. I mean, I guess I'm just stuck on the *Ilya Rosanov* I know in tabloids." David guffaws, rubbing a hand down his face and peaking at Shane then Ilya through his fingers,

"Oh." Yuna squaks, "Are the two of you using protection?"

Shane spits ginger ale across the dinner table, "Holy shit—*mom!*"

David's bottom jaw anchors into the mahogany tabletop.

Ilya's face splits into an insidious grin, "Ah. Most days. Or do I say *most* of the day?"

David points an accusatory finger at Ilya, jabbing, "That right there, that's the Ilya I've known."

His boyfriend lifts his arms, and Shane tucks away his baffled-ness to admire bulging biceps and triceps across Ilya's impressive wingspan for singular second, "The one. And. Only. Mr. Hollander."

"David." his father grunts.

Ilya's arms snap to his side, "Yes, David. Is me."

Yuna snorts and taps excess pasta sauce from the spoon before placing it across the top of the pan, "You're just too much, you know that?"

"Cannot be not enough." Ilya shrugs, "Shane has wild side too, you know?"

David eyebrows launch into the ceiling, "Oh, does he?"

Dread spreads in Shane's gut and he points at Ilya this time, "Absolutely not, behave yourself."

Ilya pouts.

"I can't believe this." Yuna whispers.

"You said that last time." Ilya reminds her, then replaces the spoon with the pot's lid and places the wooden spoon on the utensil mat next to the range.
