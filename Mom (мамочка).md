Right after the crushing anxiety in wondering whether his mother would accept him, there was his relationship with Ilya, and then... just *Ilya.*

Shane knew his lover and his mother.

Ilya was an unstoppable force. He was an uncontrollable blizzard ripping across landscapes and people alike, permanently marking them with his broken English and unpredictable behavior. Ilya was the opposite of Shane in most ways.

Shane's mother, Yuna, was calculated and observant, much like her son, but also adventurous in her own purposeful way. She maintained her reservations though they were easily displayed on her face in any given moment—so he watched for the hints of disapproval towards his lover there. They would be buried behind twinkling brown eyes and soft smile lines, etched in the creases of her crow's feet and present in the tightness of her shoulders.

He doesn't ask Ilya to temper himself for his parents' digestion and he never would, he only nervously watches them. Panics nearly every time Ilya's mouth drops open and his accent fills the rooms they all occupy like a blanket of snow. That accent, rich and alien and heavy, Shane knows Yuna is secretly enjoying hearing it.

He can tell in the way she prompts him into speech with frivolous conversation. Conversation that Ilya would never otherwise entertain if it *weren't* Yuna.

"So what's the plan if the two of you get caught?"

Her questions aren't the quick back-and-forth kind though, and Shane watches as Ilya is forced to consider his answers before handing them over.

"Is up to Shane. He has... certain reputation." Ilya responds nonchalantly while padding from the pantry with a can of skinned tomatoes back into the kitchen, "Do you have plan?"

Yuna takes the can from Ilya, her eyes narrow in thought as the Russian looms over her, "I've thought of a few but it's really awful the more I think about it."

"What? The plan?" He rumbles, voice cavernous and swelling in the Hollander's kitchen.

"No."

Shane's eyes follow his mother as she closes a five foot trek over the course of thirty seconds in deep thought.

"No," she sighs again; she's agitated, but at what?

Ilya doesn't respond, but he follows her like a baby duckling, taking two of the five she needed to station himself next to her before the range.

Yuna blinks up at him after adjusting her shawl across her shoulders, "Living in secret like this. Loving so loudly in private and having to mute it any other time."

Her shoulders drop.

"I hate this for my son."

Ilya nods, his hip drops as he shifts his weight from one leg to the other, "Me too."

Yuna only groans in response, silence buffering around the two once more as she steps away from the stoves to collect the utensils and cooking wares she'll need. Ilya, once again, is at her heels, somehow in all of his six-foot-three silhouette he manages to gracefully avoid being in her way all the while receiving pots and food items from her.

"But could be good. I'm sure you read what they write about me—arrogant, no discipline." he pauses while holding a large sauce pot, "I must think carefully when it comes to Shane. I can't let him be hurt."

Yuna pops up from behind the fridge, "That's exactly right, Ilya."

Shane's father grunts in shared enthusiasm, nodding while Yuna pats Ilya's bicep with growing approval.

"Open that, then pour it into this pot." Yuna commands, pointing at the can of tomatoes that they'd both abandoned on the kitchen counter, by the ranges.

"Okay."

"So, Ilya, what do your parents do?" his mother asks this time, much to his dismay.

Shane sucks in a sharp breath and fidgets in his seat next to his father, words tumble from his mouth before he can even consider them,

"Mom—"

Ilya's eyes meet his for the first time in minutes, they're soft, lazy like the bittersweet smile he offers to Yuna as he cuts off Shane.

"They have now both passed." he clears his throat, "I lost my father this year, and my mother when I was twelve."

Yuna's head snaps up from the pot where Ilya had just dumped the canned tomato into, blinking rapidly, "I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have asked that so casually."

"No," Ilya turns his back to stovetop, leaning against the counter top while crossing his arms, "You are just like her. Like my mama."
