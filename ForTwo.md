[JULY-AUGUST-SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER]

There had always been a shitload of things for Shane Hollander to consider, and it had been evident when she and Shane had begun their failed attempt at courting each other. Even more so as Rose had slowly gotten closer to him. He was a natural at shouldering it all, remembering small details, panicking about the things he couldn't control, steamrolling over everything else in his inevitable perfection conquests. She'd noticed Shane often kept his plate unnecessarily full, but in his own design of life it worked out for him; his greatest performances and failures had been executed under solar systems worth of stress and expectation.

So, seeing him swimming in his *husband's* sweater, just days after their wedding, nearly grinning with a head full of undone hair, blinking behind the thin lenses of his glasses, she realizes she's never once actually seen him... well...

Happy.

"Those are scandalous, girl." Rose gapes, wincing at how shrill her voice sounds in contrast to Shane's warm and cozy appearance.

Shane's grin shrinks into something shy and special, "Four-inch inseam," he stammers, "They are kind of small looking with this, uh—" she nearly gets cavities when the skin beneath his freckles dust pink, "—in Ilya's shirt."

Shane is lean himself, built very much like a wildcat, lithe and sinewy, agile and sporting muscle noticeable underneath his skin as he moves quietly around a room. By no means is this man *small.* But Ilya? His husband?

She's not surprised at his taste, at least in regards to Ilya's physical anatomy.

She shakes herself mentally: no she will not sexualize her best friend's husband, not right now at least, "I think he'd like this a lot." she announces, then presents him a snarky smirk and her voice smolders, 

"He's a pervert."

Shane rolls his eyes and gestures for her to come in, "Come on, it's freezing."

"Weird isn't it," Rose sighs, reluctantly letting Shane take her bag and suitcase from her, "this storm."

"Could be. Maybe we're straining the planet more than we think." Shane adds thoughtfully while patting the snow off of her belongings, "You know, like global warming and stuff."

They both stare at the front door.

Rose shivers now that she's passed the threshold of their front door, rubbing at her arms nervously over her heavy coat; Shane doesn't seem any more bothered by her being there than if she weren't, but she still can't quite shake the feeling that she was imposing on a space that didn't belong to her. He'd mentioned Ilya was quite alright with her hunkering down for the storm with them, encouraging her by then informing her that Ilya was leaving in the throes of the night to recover his own company also affected by a sudden mid-fall winter storm. Rose sucks in torturous breath from between her teeth. She knew Shane enough to understand hospitality wasn't something he supplied freely, but Ilya was still very much a mystery to her.

Was he actually okay with this arrangement?

"Alrighty, I want a tour now, of House Hollanov."

Shane's face flushes more deeply and Rose can't help reaching out to cup his cheeks, "House Hollanov?" he echoes, blinking innocently against her palms before she drops her hands to remove her coat,

"Haven't you seen the posts about you guys? It's the universally recognized title for the two of you as a couple on most platforms. Hollander-Rosanov, *Hollanov."*

Shane shakes his head, turning to hang her coat from a tall brass coat hook to the right of his front door, "I promised Ilya I wouldn't look at any social media until the start of next season."

"Good," Rose scoffs, "not that there's been anything bad or that you should even care; but people are super receptive to the two of you. I'm actually very pleasantly surprised Shane."

Again, she thinks of the worries he'd prattled off to her leading up to his wedding; losing endorsements, losing favor with the young heteronormative athletes who looked up to him, fans who'd decide poor plays were just chess-piece moves to hand Ilya's team a win. There had been so many he'd sounded out of breath listing the rest, validating the hate he'd receive by justifying each point with smothering empathy. And yet here he stands, one hand still on the coat hook, shoulders loose beneath the weight of Ilya's sweater, not a single crease between his brows. She watches him take her in, easy and unwound, and the relief of his demeanor catches her off guard; she has never once seen him look this light.

His tiny smile reappears before stretching into a proud, toothy grin, "Well that's good."

"Of course it is, now show me to my room!"

Shane giggles and spins around on his slipper-ed and socked feet and launches into a monologue. Rose soaks in his build from behind; he's twice her width and bearing a taper from his ribs and waist to his hips that runway models would certainly do indescribably evil deeds to attain,

"I wouldn't let Ilya sell his house on the other side of town, but he insisted we go house shopping together. He's had most of my firsts and wanted the 'first-time-buying-a-home-and-moving-in-together' one too." Shane groans as they enter their living room, stopping just before a disgustingly expensive-looking throw rug,

"I could only deny him for a few months though, so," He shrugs and makes a grand gesture at the space.

"Can't tell if I'm more surprised that you gave in or that he didn't give up." Rose snorts, to which Shane rolls his eyes,

"It's only a five bedroom, six and a half bath house—well, uh, there's an attached garage with a finished apartment above it so our parents can stay whenever and as long as they want."

Rose tilts her head; she'd been certain both of Ilya Rosanov's parents had passed, considering the charity founded in ode to his mother, and his father having died a season ago.

"Do his parents come out here too?" she asks, carefully, because she's not sure.

Shane jumps a bit, fidgeting nervously, "Well no, both of his passed. I meant—I mean just mine. He's been calling Mom *mom* lately so, I guess..."

Rose wants to hug him so tightly that his head pops off, but instead she just rubs his shoulders, "Cavities. I'm going to get cavities because of how sweet you are, Shane Hollander."

Those long lashes of his flutter, before he whines bashfully, "I don't know. But anyway this is the living room, and the kitchen is just past that wall."

Their living room is humble, encapsulated in wood paneling that's cured in a warm stain with thick wall-to-wall beams overhead, their furniture is leather, midnight black with green throw pillows and the biggest Russian flag she'd ever seen in her life hanging against the wall behind the largest couch in their sitting area. Rose thinks for a moment it's rather patriotic for a person who almost never speaks about his homeland even when asked on camera. She drags her feet through the brown fur rug beneath them and considers taking her socks off to feel the fibers against the soles of her feet,

"What is this?"

Shane glances down, "Some kind of synthetic fur. Ilya wanted a fake bear pelt."

"Ew." Rose side-eyes Shane, cutting him off clean before he can get out his next sentence, "But, obviously that would never happen."

"Not a hot day in fucking hell." Shane quips before stalking off to the kitchen area; here he stops just before his kitchen island and watches Rose curiously poke about.

It's like the living room, spacious and efficient with nothing excessive, a formal kitchen table, a bar attached to the island that could seat six or seven people, the kitchen itself had a setup professional chefs would probably kill for. The Hollanov's kitchen is a warm, terracotta-like orange, with matching Spanish tiling brandished across its floor—upon further inspection most of their kitchen is rather Spanish influenced,

"Did this Spanish inspiration perhaps come from your honeymoon?" she presses expectantly.

Shane nods, "We loved the architecture in Spain, especially the churches. We brought it home because..." he looks fondly around the room, "We wanted to feel how we felt there at home. It's like no one even knew we existed. No matter how obnoxious Ilya was being. We were normal, in love, and in public."

"Wait okay, so how even was it?! You hadn't texted me once. Bitch, it's been a whole four weeks since your wedding!"

He holds his hands high about his head, "We agreed to not use our phones unless it was for work or checking in with Mom!"

"I mean I'm not thinking I'm special or anything, but like *spill?"* Rose lifts her chin indignantly.

He fractures into thousands of pieces of sunshine almost instantaneously, he draws her in when she slides into a plush barstool while listening to his romantic elopement. Rose's forearms find her seat's armrests with childish excitement she can barely contain, and they slip once, twice, as she wriggles into a comfortable position, ready to quite literally inhale whatever Shane is about to tell her.

It's one of her favorite things, learning about Shane.

He begins in the private jet booked for them by the Centaur's owners, how they "slept" the whole flight in an actual bed, (he's a pervert is what Rose thinks but if she was Ilya Rosanov flying off to some far away land with Shane Hollander she would've ravished him too, please be so for-real).

They spent hours in the hotel's private spa, they ate fruits, and light desserts, drank so many champagne flutes he'd developed an affinity for them—and Shane Hollander did *not* participate in casual drinking, so Rose wondered just how good those mimosas had been.

They, and she nearly grips her heart through her ribcage and rips it out of her chest when he sputters explaining this, held hands walking through the streets of Spain, in four different cities, with their eyes glued to churches and corner stores. Allegedly the Spaniards are as infatuated as Shane is about Ilya's thickass accent, and they're stopped left and right whenever his husband exclaims too loudly at something, or asks for directions or the history about a certain someplace they'd seen,

"We went on our first date in Madrid," he nearly gushes, leaning across the kitchen counter opposite of Rose, "Ilya got us a reservation at some Michelin restaurant, we had a private shopping session beforehand and these ladies took, like three hours picking a week's worth of clothes out for us. Except it was like they thought we'd be changing every quarter of the day. But we both looked great, and Ilya was so sweet. He normally does this, but I felt—" Shane stops, then starts again,

"It was amazing, we were seated in like, the middle of the restaurant. Rose, nobody cared." His eyes squint because he smiles so fucking hard, "He was holding my hand and kissing me, feeding me food, it was great."

The words rush out of him like a riptide; they're so simple and small but they dig into her stomach as they flood her ears and drag her down into his experiences. She realizes at a point that he's not even speaking about Spain itself but rather the two of them while in Spain. Shane is fascinated by public displays of affection between himself and his lover of ten-fucking-years, impressed when no one looks at him sideways or sighs too loudly, that he can't hear snide remarks as he walks past other men in the street. He's shocked by how loudly Ilya loves him in the presence of others and it seems like he still can't quite wrap his mind around it.

How long had he lived suppressed, and alone, and bursting with all of this love and joy and hope? Seconds scrape by as she realizes just how privileged she'd been, loving out loud and boundless, while Shane was standing here in his kitchen beaming about his first date ever at thirty. With the man he'd been secretly in love with for nearly a decade. That they held hands on the way to brunch and lunch and dinner, that they kissed with their toes covered in sand, hugged under blinding sunlight, flirted in the fucking streets.

All of these *regular* things, listed off like heavenly privileges to Shane and it makes Rose go rigid in the bar chair.

Shane's phone vibrates and Rose is shucked out of her guilt, "Ilya just got Svetlana, apparently it's getting worse. Whole airport was on backup generators; they're on their way back now."

Rose pops up from the barstool, "Svetlana is still here?!"

"She is." Shane answers, smiling still.

"She's coming here? Me, you, Ilya, and Svetlana?"

Shane shuffles around a bit, fucking cutie, "Yes. Me, you, Ilya, and Svetlana."

"I hope this storm lasts for at least a week." Rose declares, breathlessly while gripping the edge of his marble countertops; she feels the compromising trepidation and invasiveness ease away all at once.

Svetlana Vetrova. Hockey freak and fan *extraordinaire,* Ilya Rosanov's keeper, and ever so gentle with his husband, Shane. Rose can picture a brief moment between Shane and Svetlana perfectly in her mind, flickering from frame to frame on their wedding night. She was in a backless, fit and flare number, smoothing down the edges of its skirt before lifting her hands up to run across the width of Shane's shoulder.

Svetlana was grace and gab and genius and Shane had melted right into her touch nearly as if she was Ilya himself, and he wasn't too far behind them, eyes softening at the sight so much that Rose had to blink hard and remind herself who he was.

Secretly, in her head, Rose had her filed away neatly alongside Ilya. She was the closest thing Shane's husband had to family, or at least that's what Rose told herself. Svetlana was the only person Ilya had verbally requested be there at their wedding. Shane had mentioned this, stressed of course, itching internally because his fiancé (at the time) had sought permission in doing so. Something about his and Svetlana's "physical relationship" being something that might make Shane uncomfortable.

*"He only asked to invite one person, and she's not his ex or anything but I know they have a long, intimate history. Rose, he asked if she could be there like I would deny him the singular person he's only ever asked for. I can't think of anyone else Ilya has mentioned by name from his past but Svetlana, and he feels like I would deny him that? Because they had sex?"*

She eyeballs Shane, blabbering about the texts Ilya had sent, three in succession, and compares his voice from then and now. Heavy then and now soothing, weightless even.

*"He's never fussed about our relationship... why would he think he can't have a close one of his own with the one person who really knows him? What am I, a monster? Am I making him feel isolated?"*

She had done her best to calm Shane, and it worked, but he had really looked like he wanted to cry.

"Ugh, I'm so glad it won't just be a sweaty meat fest."

And, she truly is. Svetlana, Shane, and Ilya are breathtaking, but two particularly hot Russian foreigners with accents thick as tar and egos just as viscous and sweet, and Shane being fussed over between the two? Ideal.

"Sweaty?" Shane turns his nose up, "We're hardly ever sweaty."

Rose scoffs, her voice lilts, "Two professional, male, athletes... hardly ever... sweaty."

"Only when we're—"

"Fucking?" Rose inserts, winking, and biting her bottom lip suggestively,

Shane Hollander turns pink like some virgin high school girl, "Yes but that's—"

"An absolute truth that you can't deny?"

"You're impossible." He sighs, and draws up an exasperated breath that billows across the island and smells like peppermints, "C'mon Rose, I'll show you the room you're staying in."

"An absolute truth that you can't deny?"

"You're impossible." He sighs, and draws up an exasperated breath that billows across the island and smells like peppermints, "C'mon Rose, I'll show you the room you're staying in."

The guest room Rose is staying in is at the very end of a perpendicular hall on the second floor of their house, there's only three rooms on said floor, and a balcony overlooks part of the living room beneath on the way to those rooms. She keeps her hand against the railing as they patter across a long, carpet runner that spans the length of the hallway,

"Ilya and I are downstairs, so don't worry about being too loud or anything, like music and stuff."

Shane nonchalantly provides her with the lay of his land as they come to the end of it, standing just before a heavy wooden door with a curved handle, "There's a linen closet," he juts his thumb to the right, "it's got clean towels, rags, soaps, shampoos, toothbrushes; we buy everything in bulk and stock excess there."

"Huh, so that's why you told me to walk straight to arrivals."

"Right," he smiles, soft, impartial, "just get what you need before you need it. And Ilya doesn't like the house super warm, so if you get cold come find me I have some really nice blankets my mom got me in the laundry room."

*I will not make it warm for you because my husband likes it cold.*

Rose nearly spits, but she manages, and fat grin spreads across her face.

"What?!" Shane mutters, eyes narrowing,

"Nothing, nothing," she shakes her head dramatically, "I'll bundle up so we don't melt Mr. Hollander-Rosanov."

He flinches a little at their hyphenated name, "Thank you, kindly."

"Of course, your house—no fussin'" then she adds: "happy husband, right?"

Shane looks absolutely lost, "What?"

"Happy wife, happy life?"

"Fussin' and husband don't really rhyme." Shane glowers, looking disturbed now.

Rose shoves him enough to barrel past him and into her room and it's glorious, of course. This is Mr. Real-Estate himself, Ilya always teases.

The door opens to reveal a huge bed against a wall of windows, more one gargantuan window, and ambient lighting built into the beams running along the slanted ceiling. The sheets are floral, blue, with random squiggly flowers, and the fluffiest duvet comforter she's ever seen. Plenty of pillows, in typical Shane style, and a built in wardrobe that he opens and points at,

"Keep your stuff in here."

Rose cracks to attention, saluting him, "Yes mother."

Shane snorts, "I'm gonna start up the fireplace and start thawing everything out for dinner, Ilya and Svetlana should be here in the next hour or two."

"I'll be right behind you," Rose coos, kicking her shit into the wardrobe, "Is that the bathroom?"

"Yep, all rooms have their own bathroom."

Shane leaves, and she begins unpacking, heading downstairs after changing into something tasteful: a matching sweatsuit set, and sliding on some thick wool socks. Shane's got the whole first floor toasty, and an oversized wine glass full of a Tempranillo, with the bottle open and settled on the coffee table next to a platter of fried meat and fruit.

Rose's heart squeezes.

God, the way he tries. She could pinch him.

---

Rose isn't sure how much time has passed when Ilya and Svetlana arrive at the house but she's fully aware that she and Shane are no longer the only two there.

They'd fallen asleep on the couch, bundled up beneath a blanket about the size of the furry rug beneath them, it's navy blue with a big Canadian Maple Leaf on it. Rose feels it pull from where Shane lies as she comes to, but she doesn't open her eyes immediately after she hears Ilya's deep voice cresting from just a foot or two away,

"Sweetheart," he's whispering kind of, his voice is deep enough that at the baritone he chooses it's hardly audible, "I'm home; did you drink?"

*Sweetheart,* she thinks. Said so casually by the selectively most nefarious and scathing man amongst his peers; Ilya looks Canada's Very Best Boy in the eyes and calls him Sweetheart, stirring him from his sleep.

"Huh?" Shane sputters as he shifts awake, his leg brushes against Rose's and she feels another set of legs sink against the leather.

"I'm home." Ilya announces once more, "And you have slept with your glasses on again."

Rose lets her right eye creep open, enough that she makes out Ilya's hunched back as he looms over Shane on the couch, smirking.

"Oh, I did. Shit."

"No, is okay. Bend those so that I may pick out another for you." Ilya purrs.

He captures Shane's chin in his hand and tips his head back; the kiss is deep, and while Ilya steals away the residual drowsiness from Shane with his mouth, Rose watches silently like the nasty little rat she is. Their mouths move in practiced motions, Shane's glasses clink as Ilya devours him, hand still on his lover's face, owning him.

"Is Svetlana here?" Shane gasps, pulling away from the taller male, face red even against the firelight.

Rose watches in silence as Ilya answers, his hand still on Shane’s jaw, his thumb tracing the sharp line of it in small, absent strokes. He hasn’t looked at her once; she’s almost pressed against his husband’s side under this blanket and he might as well not know she exists. All of him is turned toward Shane, every gesture and glance, like nothing else is in the room. It isn’t performative or possessive, just a version of heightened intimate tunnel vision, as if Shane is a god and Ilya is knelt between the pews of his church,

"She is settling in now. Probably will shower."

Ilya gets two more kisses, nearly four, before Shane wriggles just out of reach and against the back of the couch. The man fucking whines and Rose nearly squeals: down bad doesn’t begin to cover what Shane has done him,

"I'm glad she'll be able to spend some time with us; I've imagined it y'know, all of us hanging out."

"Oh, have you." Ilya mutters, still seemingly slighted that he won't receive any more kisses and Rose wishes she could read minds. Ilya's looking fond enough at Shane's statement, but there's something else cindering in his eyes.

Rose is careful not to stir as Shane rises up, pulling the blanket with him, "Yeah. She's important to you. Of course I have."

Their voices are soft as the gaze they hold while they speak.

"Maybe Rose is your Svetlana then?" Ilya jokes, a bit louder,

"No, Ilya is a Lily not a Rose." Svetlana says from above; Rose remembers the balcony above the living room in that moment, "Hey Shanya."

"Shanya?" Shane repeats, and Rose lets her eye drop open just a bit more when Shane sits up entirely, nuzzling into Ilya's neck for only an imperceptible second, "Don't, we'll wake up Rose Ilya."

"She has permission." Ilya grunts, his rough features become sharp for a moment, "Is affectionate. Like how Scott Hunter is *Dinosaur* or *Grandpa.* And, is almost dinner, Rose Landry needs to wake up."

"I don't do that." Shane grits out, shoving Ilya a bit and forcing him to stand at the edge of the couch as he loses his balance.

Ilya shifts ahead of them now and Rose opens both her eyes because Ilya still hasn't looked over at her. Above Svetlana's slim figure is disappearing down the hallway, and Shane is scooting to get up from the couch. Ilya captures him at the waist and shepherds him into the kitchen,

"The storm is bad, Shane. They may need to stay with us for about a week or two..."

Ilya is out of earshot far too soon and Rose isn't done being a government drone; she slides off the couch with soundless finesse and scurries to the wall just before the kitchen, standing outside the threshold and hoping her presence won't be noticed. 

"...mind? Would you?"

Rose steps forward, dragging her feet forward until they're just before the light leaking into the living room corridor from the kitchen, she strains against the wall.

"Two hot women and a sexy husband trapped in my house for weeks? A travesty," Ilya groans, then wails in theatrical despair, "We just need Scott Hunter here for you and will be perfect holiday."

"Will you leave Hunter alone?" Shane snipes, voice peaking a bit with irritation,

"Fine, then Troy Barrett?"

Rose shuffles forward, toes now soaked in the warm recessed lighting. but she can make them out clearly in the kitchen. Shane is rummaging around in the fridge, handing off the ingredients for dinner without so much as glancing at what Ilya might be doing with them when they are removed from his hands,

"Ilya, you'd better knock it off."

"Ugh, you are no fun Shane Hollander."

Shane groans, finishes his fridge raid and turns to his husband, "I was thinking salad and roasted chicken."

"Yes, pasta tomorrow. I bought the one you like, you saw yes?"

"Okay, maybe with chicken parm and goat cheese?" He obliges Ilya, "That sounds good."

"Yes, and mashed potatoes today; we still have not used all of what mom gave us. They will begin seeking water soon." Ilya jabs at the air the way potatoes' roots do after sitting in dark pantries for long enough,

"You wash them and get them boiled then." Shane commands.

"Coffee first, I need it." Ilya then adds, stepping away to do just that.

And Rose *watches.*

Her relationship with Shane was an absolute fucking disaster. She spent minutes considering things to say and do to appease him or even just to make him laugh or smile but most of the time Shane was so cryptically literal it was impossible to achieve the reactions she wanted from him. Rose chalks it up to how much less guarded Shane is with Ilya, and also being gay and knowing it now.

She looks down at the stained wooden floors.

It was ever so obvious that Shane had always been operating on a shakily built script, they both had, but here with Ilya he was nothing less than himself. He wasn't an awkward actor forced onto a stage to play a role he couldn't even understand, he was absolutely loved to pieces and Rose could see it just as well as Shane could likely feel it. With how his shoulders were slack and relaxed, how he openly accepted affection from Ilya without the split second of wide-eyes that Rose often noted while going in for a kiss or the rigid body language he adopted after waking up and noticing her nearby.

"Have a cup with me?" Ilya murmurs to Shane while he brings a large, stainless steel skillet to temperature, he steps behind Shane, watching the pan before craning his neck downwards and (Rose assumes because their backs are to her) sinks his teeth gently into Shane's neck.

Shane leans away from Ilya to make more room for him, then drops back against him, rolling his head onto the Russian's shoulder, "Sure, but do we have non-dairy creamer?"

"Yes, yes, we have all your special dietary things Shane." Ilya mutters into his skin,

"Does Svetlana have any allergies? I know Rose used to have one or two when she was little."

Rose smiles.

He'd always been so good at listening, at actually listening, not like any man she'd ever been with before or now, after. She'd said that in passing, just trying to make conversation when they'd first met.

"No... But she says all the time this thing: spicy and buttery and salty, and not sweet. She does not like sweet very much."

Shane thinks about this, then escapes Ilya's embrace to grab the aluminum bowl full of marinated chicken, "That's good to know."

Ilya has moved back to their coffee machine, which honestly looks like something only a serious coffee enthusiast would purchase, and grumbles, "Is it? She orders the most expensive fucking thing on the menu no matter where we are."

"So? Savory is normally healthier anyway. Rose loves sweets, and she doesn't work out that much so I have no idea how she maintains her shape."

"What's her shape like?" Ilya chuckles, pouring the coffee into two large, ceramic mugs, and fixing them the way they both like it.

Shane whips around from the crackling chicken searing in the pan, "Don't even start."

"What?!" Ilya shrugs, theatrics turned on again, "Sveta has a shape you'd never forget. She's so tiny too, I could fit my hands around her like a little cat."

He makes a circle with his hands before picking up his mug and drinking some of the coffee.

Shane's chin drops, his eyes are poking around, and his face slowly, *slowly* blossoms pink, "Rose is small like that too." he finally admits.

"Is nice, yes?" Ilya persists, his lips are just above the rim of his mug, and his eyes lecherously inquisitive.

Maybe he's like Rose.

Maybe Ilya has a sexual curiosity that's satiated by hearing about the others' thoughts and preferences. Though, she considers, any *normal* person would rightfully be put off by his question, especially if they were married to him. Shane seems used to this kind of prying, uncomfortable if anything but not offended. Ilya must press against boundaries often.

Shane drags his eyes across the five feet of space that separates him from Ilya before responding, "Yeah, it was, made me feel huge."

"Well you are not *small.*"

Shane frowns and takes the mug Ilya offers, "Well yeah, I'm a guy."

"No, you are small man, like Pike."

Shane rolls his eyes.

"Well of course, in comparison to me," Ilya pulls his mug away from his mouth and uses his left hand to lift his quarter-zip sweater up and over his chest, flashing Shane and Rose is certain he's got the same shit eating grin he wears in the penalty boxes on now, "I am big Russian man."

Shane, the poor fucking thing manages to stare long enough that Ilya says, "You can touch, it is yours," before spinning around and flipping the chicken, one at a time,

"You make me feel small."

Ilya freezes, "I'm sorry?"

"I said," Shane grunts, "you make me feel small."

"What? Like woman?"

"No Ilya, like... I don't know. Soft? Safe? Kind of stupid sometimes."

Rose covers her mouth. Well then.

Ilya seems to consider what his husband is saying as he drains away his coffee (how has he nearly finished the whole fucking cup?) and responds carefully,

"Good. I am your husband. You do not need brain when I am around. You use it too much anyway."

Rose grins and a sharp breath that was nearly a snort escapes her lips: God, Shane is just a fucking girl like her.

She's about ready to rain on their parade when a soft hand reaches around and covers her nose and mouth, dread sinks into her bone and goosebumps erupt across her skin as she's pushed gently against the wall. Her breathing is jagged and her senses scream at her, forcing her jaw wider to *bite* when Svetlana's velvet voice tumbles into her ear,

"Are we spying, Rose Landry?"

Rose's preparations to flail and make a break for the kitchen melt into embarrassment as Svetlana's hand lowers slowly from her face.

"Svetlana, holy shit." Rose bends over opposite of the light spilling into the hallway from the kitchen, she wipes her sweaty palms against her knees, "Please I'm dying."

"Not yet, but if Ilya catches you snooping you might be."

Svetlana looks perfect, caramel skin glowing in the ambient lighting, lips a delicious pout, and her wild curls tucked neatly into a high bun that they spring from unceremoniously here and there,

"But Ilya seems like the type to *want* to be caught."

"He is," Rose tries to not focus on her accent, on the way it makes English seem so sophisticated, "but on his terms."

She tilts her head a bit after standing upright again, "Wait, what?"

"Ilya will not simply share the things he likes Rose. He is a selfish and easily scorned boy. It is what makes him so precious."

"What about you?" Rose blurts.

She covers her mouth in confusion and Svetlana only raises a brow. Rose hadn't meant to ask that, she had thought it, but there was no reason to pry into Svetlana's business: she seemed like something no one could have if she wasn't *wanting* to be *wanted.* Not that that mattered.

And it didn't.

Svetlana's a woman.

"I do not share." Svetlana amends simply, her face emotionless and stoic.

Rose ponders Ilya and Svetlana, chasing ideas of how they might've operated together in Russia.

Had they met at school? Maybe they were high school sweethearts? College kids who had gotten really close while enrolled? Is four years even enough to be as close as the two of them seemed?

*"Ah,"* Svetlana covers her own mouth this time, "Shane has turned him into a big, gooey mush of a man."

Rose peeks around the corner and sees where Ilya has Shane hoisted onto the counter top to the side of their range, his upper body shields Shane from view but anyone could hear the sounds of their mouths crashing together—of Shane's little gasps and moans and Ilya's encouraging rumbles that follow them.

"Wait, stop, Il—"

Ilya leans forward, pressing himself deeper between Shane's legs, "I already know how this week will go Sweetheart. Let me touch you now because you will not later."

"When did I say that?" Shane hisses, shoving Ilya away with his hands spread across the blonde's chest, "You can touch me, we're home."

"With two guests. You won't let me at your parents' and you want me to believe that you will here, with other people?"

"Well, it's different with those two, they—"

Ilya whistles, "Threesomes only if with women? I am okay with this."

That earns Ilya a hard hit to the shoulder.

"No asshole, I'm saying that I don't think they'll... be weird about it."

"Weird? About us fucking in our own house? Would be weird if they were weird about that."

Shane groans and runs his hands down his face, "We don't work with them Ilya, and they aren't hockey players. So like, I'm saying they'll probably ignore it."

Ilya tuts at him, clicking his tongue in disagreement, "Shane you might have dated and fucked women but you do *not* understand them."

Rose and Svetlana peer around the kitchen's threshold, gripping the molding, Ilya's lowered his voice and speaks with his forehead pressed against Shane's.

"And what the fuck do you mean by that?"

"Women are like little rats, they will admit it, every time. They will hide in the walls and watch and deny when they are caught."

"Svetlana and Rose aren't like that." Shane snaps, eyes narrowing, "And you shouldn't—!"

Ilya grabs Shane by the collar of the sweatshirt he's stolen from Ilya's half of their closet and drags him across the kitchen tiles towards the hallway, face stone-cold, eyes flared. Shane's feet trip trying to keep up. He's stalking across the opening with his shoulder squared, purposefully, his arm bent behind him to leash his husband along.

He knows.

Or rather, Rose gasps, he's *known.*

There's no telling when he caught on either, maybe when she had peeked at him on the couch, when she ran across the hallway, when he turned around to pour their coffee. She discovers in this moment that Ilya Rosanov is as dangerous on terracotta tiles as he is on ice. His lethal situational awareness isn't just for when he dons skates, it's constant. Ilya is a fucking apex predator.

Svetlana peeks up at Rose where she'd assumed a crouch to spy alongside her and as their eyes meet they scramble for the living room. Their socked feet slip and slide in an epic struggle for purchase across the hardwood floors and surely catching the light and Ilya howls in victory,

"See, four little paws, you hear them running to the living room now?"

"What?" Shane is tugging at Ilya's wrist, not paying attention at all, "Ilya stop grabbing the sweater like that, you're going to stretch out the neck!"

"Quickly Shane, look!"

Rose's heartbeat is thrumming in her ears like bass lines vibrating a club and she swallows down a laugh along with her tongue as she and Svetlana break for the living room, panting and tripping the whole way. They hit walls sloppily as they careen into the living room and Svetlana breaks into an incriminating giggle. Just as they make it to their safe point Rose launches up and *over* the coffee table, wine, and charcuterie board Shane had assembled for her, Svetlana though, is not nearly as nimble.

*"Blyat!"* she cries out when her shin connects with the side of it, knocking over Rose's empty glass of wine (but somehow not the whole bottle) and unsalted crackers are launched just ahead of where they lie across the couch, awkwardly.

Rose shushes her, ripping the navy blue blanket from beneath Svetlana's body and then her own and whipping it out to cover them.

It settles perfectly just as Ilya barrels into the living room with Shane a second later, flicking on the overhead lights and successfully flash-banging the four of them.

"Is the movie so good you have lost your breath?" He exclaims with arched brows,

"Yup." Rose squeaks, and Ilya's eyes sharpen on her, "So good, you just wouldn't get it."

Svetlana groans, leg gripped to her chest.

Rose jerks her chin at her, and Svetlana frowns.

"Are you okay?" Shane panics, "What happened?"

Ilya lets out an exasperated breath and slaps his arms down to his side, "They are caught rats! They ran because they were caught!"

"Caught doing what?" Rose challenges.

Svetlana lets out a devastating moan this time and Ilya's hazel eyes immediately snap to Svetlana next to Rose, his brow pinches, "Did you hit your leg on the coffee table?"

*"Daaaaaaa!"* she wails, eyes squeezed together in pain.

Shane and Ilya crowd around them, Shane looks uselessly worried, and Ilya rips the blanket away, slapping at Svetlana's hands and finding a purpling bruise immediately,

"Christ Sveta," he grunts, "you are only graceful on ice and in heels, why are you acting stupid?"

"Don't call her stupid while she's in pain Ilya. I'm getting some ice."

Ilya watches Shane jog off towards the kitchen, then turns back to them.

"No running in the house!" He declares, then furrows his brow when Shane runs past them in the opposite direction towards the front door, "Shane! No running in the house!" he barks,

"Need snow!" Shane hollers back and the front door clicks open then shut.

"You see, now my husband has gone into Canadian wilderness because of you."

"Отвали!" Svetlana hisses; whatever word she hurls at him is beautiful, pronounced *otvalí* and looping out of her mouth more eloquently than any English syllables she's used.

Rose has no idea what the fuck it means.

Ilya rubs where the bruise darkens, and Rose sits up, she grabs Svetlana's hand and squeezes it in apology and Ilya—Ilya's head jerks fractionally, enough for Rose to almost jump out of her skin, and his face devolves with unfamiliar irritation.

Oh.

Rose glances at where Svetlana's hand grips hers back.

She's touching something that's *his,* she supposes.

Shane, with impeccable timing as per usual, returns with a Ziploc bag full of snow that he wraps around Svetlana's leg, "So smart and sensible. Ilya does not deserve you." she muses, eyes sparkling.

Ilya sneers, lifting his chin, "Wrong. Because I now have you both."

Rose can't help smiling, and peers up at Shane. Shane now red as a tomato,

"You're too nice to me, Svetlana." He murmurs with that smile that causes cavities.

Svetlana backs up against the couch, leaning against the pillows there, "You are pretty."

"Ah!" Ilya waggles his finger between the two of them, "None of that. Shane your chicken needs to go in the stove, no?"

Shane jumps, "Shit, yeah, Svetlana please ice that."

"Okay, Captain." She sighs.

Ilya leans forward, "No—no, I am the Captain. What?"

"Don't worry I won't steal him away from you, Ilyushka."

Ilya raises a single brow and leans towards her, still bent down on his knees ahead of the couch, "No you cannot please him the way I can."

"*Da,* but I can tease him. He is cute wearing red."

"What is *Da?*" Rose interrupts, bravely.

"Yes," they say in unison, heads turned towards her,

"And ought-volley?" Rose repeats, calling back on how it sounded phonetically in her head, "Отвали?"

Svetlana beams and for Rose it's very much like watching a diamond glint underneath sunlight, "Very good Rose, you and Shanya are quick learners."

Rose bites her bottom lip to keep herself from grinning, "Shanya?"

"Ah, Shane. Shanya is... an informality. Like Ilya is Lily. A nickname."

So then Svetlana calls Shane, Shanya, and Ilya: "Ilyushka."

Ilya's shoulders tense a bit before he shoots to his feet, smiling, but the expression fails to reach his eyes, "Do not call me that."

"Right, sorry." Rose looks away; he might belong to Shane but he's still six foot three and she definitely took Shane away from him at one point. They've never discussed it but she can always tell the hard feelings are there regardless of whether or not he likes her. He's clearly not quick to let go of hard feelings. 

But how's she even supposed to know *if* Ilya's carrying a grudge?

Svetlana's eyes flick between the two of them,

"Ilya," she bites, "go help Shanya with the food."

Ilya goes without a single word, he only makes eye contact with Svetlana for a few ice cold seconds and then disappears down the hall after Shane,

"Sorry. Thanks? I mean, I guess." Rose begins, unable to meet Svetlana's gaze.

"No don't be," she fans herself with her hand and watches the rest of the fire Shane had built shrink to embers,

"Looks like there needs to be a talk."
